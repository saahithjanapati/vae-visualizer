# variational-auto-encoder



#TODO:
[x] understand sample code
[x] run on MNIST
[x] run on FashionMNIST
[ ] Experiment with different architectures
[ ] select final model architecture and stick with it
[ ] interactive scatter plot with t-SNE algorithm to visualize latent embeddings of training set elements (Plotly ?)
[ ] select two points on graph (or input your own) and create interpolation gif between the two vectors ???
[ ] visualization of latent space during training using t-sne or pca?? just add to dashboard at end
